# Numeric Matrix Processor
## Learning outcomes
Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using arrays in practice.
### Stage 1/6: Addition
Use multi-dimensional arrays to add matrices.

### Stage 2/6: Multiplication by number
Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result.

### Stage 3/6: Matrix by matrix multiplication 
Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your matrix processor.

### Stage 4/6: Transpose
Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition, and then add this option to the menu.

### Stage 5/6: Determined!
Use recursion to enable your program to find the determinant.

### Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix 
Yet another possible operation is finding the inverse of a matrix: add this option to your program.
